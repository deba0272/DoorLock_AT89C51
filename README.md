## Introduction

To create a door lock system using an 8051 microcontroller in Proteus, you'll need to follow these steps:

Circuit Design: Design the circuit in Proteus using the 8051 microcontroller, a keypad (to input the password), an LCD (to display messages), a motor (to act as the door lock), and any additional components needed.
Programming: Write the code for the 8051 microcontroller to control the door lock system. This code will involve reading input from the keypad, comparing it with a predefined password, displaying messages on the LCD, and controlling the motor.
Simulation: Simulate the circuit and the code in Proteus to test the functionality of the door lock system. Make sure to test various scenarios, such as entering the correct and incorrect password, to ensure that the system behaves as expected.
